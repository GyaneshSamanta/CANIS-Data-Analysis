    - So I believe this study showcased more similarities between true and false news rather than differences. 
    - It is a NECESSITY of the hour to have a deep understanding of what might distinguish two news pieces which are similar to each other but one is true of the two.
    - This reminds me of a game called one truth and two lies. 
    - So if we could identify the key features which distinguish the lie and the truth, in our daily lives we could discard misinformation better.
